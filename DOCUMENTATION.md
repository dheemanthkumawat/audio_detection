## Core Components

### Audio Processing Pipeline
1. **ALSA Input**: Captures microphone audio at device sample rate
2. **Audio Processor**: Handles multi-rate buffering and windowing
3. **PANNs CNN14**: Classifies audio into 527 sound categories
4. **Speech Detection**: If speech detected, triggers Vosk STT processing
5. **Anomaly Detection**: Checks classifications against custom profile rules
6. **Event Management**: Logs and stores all detections with timestamps

### Context-Aware Profiles
The system uses specialized configuration profiles optimized for different environments:

- **default.yaml**: General purpose monitoring
- **quiet-office.yaml**: Office environments with sensitive speech detection
- **home-security.yaml**: Residential security with break-in detection
- **baby-monitor.yaml**: Infant monitoring with crying detection
- **elderly-care.yaml**: Senior care with fall and emergency detection
- **workshop-safety.yaml**: Industrial safety with equipment monitoring
- **classroom-monitor.yaml**: Educational environment monitoring
- **outdoor-surveillance.yaml**: Perimeter security monitoring

Each profile configures:
- Speech and anomaly detection thresholds
- Custom anomaly detection groups
- Buffer durations and session management
- Storage retention policies
- Network access permissions

## AI Models

### PANNs CNN14 (Audio Classification)
- **Purpose**: Real-time audio classification
- **Classes**: 527 sound categories from AudioSet
- **Performance**: mAP 0.431, ~50ms inference time
- **Input**: 32kHz audio, 1.0s windows

### Vosk STT (Speech Recognition)
- **Purpose**: Offline speech-to-text conversion
- **Language**: English
- **Performance**: ~15% WER on clean speech
- **Input**: 16kHz audio, 5.0s rolling buffer

### Future Model Support
- **Whisper**: Enhanced speech recognition with multilingual support
- **YAMNet**: Lightweight alternative to PANNs
- **Custom Models**: Domain-specific fine-tuned models

## Technical Innovations

### Smart Buffering System
The system uses multi-rate buffering to solve speech recognition challenges:

**Problem**: Traditional systems struggle with:
- Partial words cut off at window boundaries
- Determining speech session start/end points
- Balancing real-time response vs accuracy

**Solution**: 
- Rolling 5-second buffer for Vosk maintains speech context
- Dual recognition strategy (partial + final results)
- Smart session boundary detection
- Context-aware thresholds per environment

### Real-time Processing
- Parallel audio classification and speech recognition
- WebSocket streaming for instant frontend updates
- Memory-efficient circular buffers
- Sub-500ms end-to-end latency

## Performance Metrics

### Testing Protocol
- **Dataset**: ESC-50 (2,000 labeled audio clips, 50 categories)
- **Metrics**: Classification accuracy, speech WER, anomaly precision/recall
- **Environments**: Office, home, outdoor, industrial settings

### Results
| Metric | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| Classification Accuracy | 87.5% |
| Speech WER | 19.3% |
| End-to-end Latency | 472ms |
| Concurrent Users | 50+ |
| Continuous Runtime | 72+ hours |

## Usage

### Basic Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start with web interface
python main_web.py

# Use specific profile
python main_web.py --config-profile quiet-office
```

### Configuration
```python
from src.pipeline import LiveAudioPipeline

# Load specific profile
pipeline = LiveAudioPipeline(config_profile="home-security")
pipeline.run()
```

### Web Interface
- Start pipeline: `python main_web.py`
- Open browser: `http://localhost:8765` or `web/index.html`
- Real-time display of speech, anomalies, and classifications

## Current Limitations

### Technical Constraints
- Single audio input source
- English-only speech recognition
- GPU recommended for real-time performance
- Minimum 400ms latency due to model inference

### Detection Challenges
- Performance degrades in very noisy environments (>60dB)
- Cannot distinguish multiple simultaneous speakers
- Struggles with similar-sounding audio signatures
- Accent sensitivity affects speech recognition accuracy

## Future Development

### Short-term (Q1-Q2 2024)
- Whisper integration for improved speech recognition
- Speaker diarization for multi-speaker scenarios
- Custom model fine-tuning for specific domains

### Medium-term (Q3-Q4 2024)
- Mobile application development
- Edge device deployment (Raspberry Pi)
- Predictive analytics and trend analysis

### Long-term (2025+)
- Multimodal fusion (audio + video + sensors)
- Natural language query interface
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving improvements
